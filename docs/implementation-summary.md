## Date: Current Date

## Overview

Today we implemented an email notification system for the Nexonware EAP platform. This system sends email notifications to specified recipients when users submit their email addresses through the subscription form to request an invite.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Created API Route for Email Subscriptions**

   - Created a new API route at `src/app/api/subscribe/route.ts`
   - Implemented email sending functionality using nodemailer
   - Set up validation for email format
   - Configured the email to be sent to two specified recipients

2. **Updated EmailSubscribe Component**

   - Modified the existing component to call the new API endpoint
   - Implemented proper error handling and user feedback
   - Enhanced the user experience with loading states and success/error messages

3. **Utilized Existing Email Configuration**

   - Leveraged the existing email configuration in the `.env` file
   - Used the Gmail SMTP server with the provided credentials

4. **Created Documentation**

   - Created detailed documentation in `docs/email-notification-implementation.md`
   - Updated the main README.md to include information about the new feature
   - Added email configuration details to the environment setup section

5. **Created Test Script**
   - Implemented a test script at `scripts/test-email.js` to verify email functionality
   - The script can be run independently to test the email configuration

## Technical Details

- **Email Service**: Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP
- **Recipients**: neeleshsharma351@gmail.com and nsharma1@me.iitr.ac.in
- **Email Content**: HTML-formatted notification with subscriber's email
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling both in the API and UI
- **User Experience**: Loading states and feedback messages for users

## Next Steps

- Monitor email delivery and adjust settings if needed
- Consider implementing email templates for more consistent branding
- Add analytics to track subscription rates and conversion
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the subscription form

## Conclusion

The email notification system is now fully implemented and ready for use. When users submit their email addresses through the subscription form, the system will send a notification email to the specified recipients, allowing for timely follow-up with potential users.
