# Extension Policy Schema Update Summary (V6)

## Overview

We've updated the extension policy schema to focus exclusively on paste actions, removing upload, download, and form submission controls. This streamlined approach simplifies the policy configuration while maintaining robust metrics collection capabilities.

## Key Changes

### 1. Schema Structure

**Before:**

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "actions": {
    "paste": {
      "restrictSensitive": false,
      "restrict": false
    },
    "upload": {
      "restrictSensitive": false,
      "restrict": false
    },
    "download": {
      "restrictSensitive": false,
      "restrict": false
    },
    "formSubmission": {
      "restrictSensitive": false,
      "restrict": false
    }
  },
  "metricsCollection": {
    "urlCapture": true,
    "fileUploads": true,
    "fileDownloads": true,
    "clipboardEvents": true
  },
  "metricsSettings": {
    "retentionDays": 90,
    "anonymizeUserData": false,
    "persistData": true
  },
  "blocklist": [],
  "allowlist": [],
  "updatedAt": {
    "seconds": 1741267862,
    "nanoseconds": 95000000
  },
  "updatedBy": "userId"
}
```

**After:**

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "actions": {
    "paste": {
      "logData": false,
      "restrictSensitive": false,
      "restrict": false
    }
  },
  "metricsCollection": {
    "urlCapture": true,
    "fileUploads": true,
    "fileDownloads": true,
    "clipboardEvents": true
  },
  "metricsSettings": {
    "retentionDays": 90,
    "anonymizeUserData": false,
    "persistData": true
  },
  "blocklist": [],
  "allowlist": [],
  "updatedAt": {
    "seconds": 1741267862,
    "nanoseconds": 95000000
  },
  "updatedBy": "userId"
}
```

### 2. Action Properties Changes

- Removed upload, download, and formSubmission action types
- Retained only paste actions with three properties:
  - `logData`: Controls whether paste actions are logged
  - `restrict`: Controls whether pasting is allowed
  - `restrictSensitive`: Controls content scanning for sensitive data

### 3. UI Simplification

- Removed UI sections for upload, download, and form submission policies
- Focused the UI on paste actions and metrics collection
- Maintained the same metrics collection and settings UI

## Files Updated

1. **src/types/policies.ts**

   - Updated the `ExtensionPolicy` interface to include only paste in actions
   - Updated the default policy to reflect the new structure
   - Modified the conversion function to handle the simplified schema

2. **src/lib/policyService.ts**

   - Enhanced schema detection to identify the correct version
   - Added support for migrating from previous schemas with multiple actions
   - Updated field mappings for backward compatibility

3. **src/app/dashboard/extension-policy/page.tsx**
   - Removed UI sections for upload, download, and form submission policies
   - Maintained the paste actions section with all three controls
   - Kept the metrics collection and settings sections unchanged

## Benefits of the New Schema

1. **Focused Configuration**: Simplified policy management by focusing on paste actions only
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer options make policy configuration more straightforward
3. **Streamlined UI**: Cleaner interface with fewer sections and controls
4. **Maintained Metrics**: Preserved comprehensive metrics collection capabilities
5. **Better UX**: More focused user experience with less cognitive load

## Backward Compatibility

The system continues to support multiple schema versions and automatically upgrades policies to the latest version when read and saved. When converting from previous schemas with multiple actions, only the paste actions are retained while maintaining all metrics collection settings.
